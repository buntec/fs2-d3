# fs2-d3

A pure FP take on [D3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3) for [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/)
built on top of [Cats-Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) and [FS2](https://fs2.io/).

Disclaimer: This library is experimental, so use at your own risk! No artifacts are published yet.

## Getting started

Have a look at the `examples` sub-project. You can run the examples by doing `sbt examples/fastLinkJS` and then serving
the `index.html` from the `examples` folder using something like [Live Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server).
